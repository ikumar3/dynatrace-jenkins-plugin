  This plugin makes it possible to integrate data from <a href="http://www.dynatrace.com">dynaTrace</a> into your Jenkins versionBuild.<br/>
  By using dynaTrace in your unit and performance tests you can get deeper insight into what's actually happening in your tests and 
  keep of metrics like executed database statements, the number of exceptions being thrown etc. Tests should be conducted with the dynaTrace
  agent injected, and after the versionBuild, the
  performance statistics will be fetched from the REST interface and shown in the Jenkins interface.
